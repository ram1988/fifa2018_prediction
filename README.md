I just played around with some Machine Learning algorithms to predict the champion of FIFA 2018. 

I ran virtual tournaments for each algorithm  simulating the FIFA schedule comprising Leagues, Super 16, Quarters, Semis and the Grand Finale. 

Dataset:

https://www.kaggle.com/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017

Considered attributes are:

1.) Two competing team's ranking history and win ratio.

2.) Home Ground Advantage.




**Algorithms:**

Logistic Regression - Spain

Random Forest - Spain

Multinomial Regression - France

SVM - Germany
